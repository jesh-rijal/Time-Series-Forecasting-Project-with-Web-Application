Brent Oil Price Forecasting using Time Series Models

Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting Brent crude oil prices using multiple time-series forecasting models, including:
    • ARIMA
    • SARIMA
    • Prophet
    • Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

The main objective of this project is to analyze historical Brent oil price trends and build a robust forecasting system capable of handling:
    • Long-term trends
    • Structural changes
    • Market volatility
    • External global shocks

The final deployed forecasting model is the Prophet model, selected based on overall forecasting stability and cross-validation performance.

Dataset Information
    • Dataset Name: Brent Oil Prices
    • Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
    • Rows: 9,011
    • Columns: 2
        o Date
        o Price
Time Period
    • From: 20-May-1987
    • To: 14-Nov-2022

Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning

The following preprocessing steps were performed:
    • Checked missing values
    • Checked duplicate records
    • Checked outliers using Z-score
    • Checked missing timestamps using pd.date_range()
    • Handled missing timestamps using forward filling
    • Converted date column into datetime format
    • Set date column as DataFrame index

2. Feature Engineering

Created time-based features such as:
    • Day of week
    • Day of month

Performed:
    • Resampling
    • Differencing
    • Rolling statistics generation

Models Developed
  ARIMA
    • ARIMA(1,1,0)
    • Trend component included
    
  SARIMA
    • order=(2,1,1)
    • seasonal_order=(1,1,1,7)

  Prophet
  Included:
    • Changepoint detection
    • Seasonality tuning
    • External regressors:
        o Financial crisis
        o COVID-19
        o Russia–Ukraine war
        o Oil supply shock

ETS (Exponential Smoothing)
Included:
    • Trend handling
    • Damped trend
    • Log transformation
    • Variance stabilization

Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
    • RMSE
    • MAE
    • MAPE
Time-based cross-validation was performed using:
TimeSeriesSplit

Final Model Selection
The Prophet model was selected as the final forecasting model because it:

  • Handled structural changes effectively
  • Adapted better to external market shocks
  • Produced more stable forecasts
  • Achieved stronger cross-validation performance
  
Model Deployment
The project was deployed using:
  • Streamlit for web application deployment
  • Joblib for model serialization

The Streamlit application includes:
  • Forecast horizon selection
  • Historical data visualization
  • Shock event controls
  • Forecast plots
  • Downloadable forecast results

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Required Libraries
Example libraries used in this project:
   • pandas
   • numpy
   • matplotlib
   • scikit-learn
   • statsmodels
   • prophet
   • streamlit
   • joblib
   
Run Streamlit Application

Streamlit Features
The application allows users to:
    • Select forecast horizon
    • Visualize historical Brent oil prices
    • Generate future forecasts
    • Enable/disable global shock events
    • View forecast confidence intervals
    • Download forecast results as CSV

Example Forecast Output
The forecast includes:
    • Predicted oil price
    • Lower confidence interval
    • Upper confidence interval

Cross-Validation
Time-series cross-validation was implemented using:
  TimeSeriesSplit(
      n_splits=5,
      test_size=180
  )
This ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen future data while preserving chronological order.
